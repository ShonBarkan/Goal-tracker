# Goal Tracking App
Overview
The Goal Tracking App is a personal productivity tool designed to help users track and manage their goals. The app allows users to set goals for various areas, such as building habits (e.g., "not eating sweets") or improving skills (e.g., typing speed). It offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to track their progress, set targets, and stay motivated.

### The app will provide users with the ability to:

Set different types of goals, such as habits or skills
Track daily progress (e.g., mark a habit as done or record a skill score)
View historical progress data and analyze trends over time
Set up notifications or reminders for goal completion
The project is built using modern technologies, including React with TypeScript for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB or PostgreSQL for the database. The entire project is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
React with TypeScript: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
CSS/SCSS: For styling the app and ensuring a clean, user-friendly design.

### Backend:
FastAPI: A fast, modern web framework for building RESTful APIs with Python. It is used to manage the app's logic and handle requests from the frontend.
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization.

### Database:
MongoDB or PostgreSQL: MongoDB will be used for flexible, document-based storage (ideal for storing goal progress), or PostgreSQL will be used for relational storage with a more structured schema.
Deployment:

### Docker
The app will be containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments (development, testing, production).
